# Data_Eng_project
This repository contains a comprehensive data engineering project designed to analyze cycling performance data. The project focuses on building an end-to-end data pipeline that extracts, load and transforms data from various sources, leveraging modern cloud technologies and Python programming.

# Project Objectives
Data Collection: Scrape and collect cycling race data, including race results, rider statistics, and event details, from websites such as ProCyclingStats.
Data Storage: Store raw and processed data in an Azure Data Lake with a well-organized directory structure for scalability and efficiency.
Data Transformation: Process and clean raw data using tools like Databricks and Azure Data Factory, and convert data into Parquet and Delta formats for optimized querying.
